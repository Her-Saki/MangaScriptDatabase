20XX A.D....
Six months have passed since Sigma's rebellion...
"Let me go! I'm gonna rescue the commander!"
While the world seemed to be at peace, the Irregular criminal rate was actually higher than before the rebellion...
"Calm down, Boy!"
"But the commander it's still inside!"
"We must rescue..."
"Him..."
"Co..."

---PAGE 6---
"What are you so nervous about, Boy?"
"Commander!! Why did you return there?!"
"Well..."
"This little guy was there..."
"A... cat...?"
"Our Rescue Corps exist to protect the lives of others."
"It doesn't matter how many times we have to enter a burning building in order to fulfill our mission."

---PAGE 7---
"An Irregular!"
"Is this the bomber that caused all this?!"
"Kuh..."
"Take the wounded people to a safe place!"
"B-But..."
"Don't forget your unit is unarmed! Now move out!"
"Please be careful, commander!"

---PAGE 8---
"GIII-GI-GI-GI-GIII..."
"Please be quiet while I repair you! I'll turn you back to normal!"
"KYAAAAAAAAHHH!"
"GOOOOOHHH..."
"Woah!"
"?!"

---PAGE 9---
"GYOOOOOHHH..."
"?!"
"His eyes...!"
"His eyes aren't those of a mere Irregular!"
"They're infected by some malicious program!"
"If I don't defeat him..."
"The damage will only get worse."
"But still..."
"I still..."

---PAGE 10---
"Can't bring myself to fight..."
"Why must I keep doing this?!"
"Commander!"

---PAGE 11---
"How's their condition?"
"Nothing to worry about!"
"Okay, let's hurry to the hospital!"
"Yes sir!"
"..."
"Why could have drove this guy into that frenzy?"
"Hm?"
"This chip..."

---PAGE 12---
"Has the symbol of Sigma!"
"What is this chip for...?"
"Why does it have Sigma's emblem?"
"Is this the work of Sigma's army refugees...?"
"Or could it be...?"

---PAGE 13---
"Could it be that instead..."
"It's HIS own work...?"
Neo Irregular Hunters Base
"NEGLIGENCE!!"

---PAGE 14---
"This is plain carelessness!!"
"Hey! Aren't you happy that the wounded are safe, Heel?"
"Our duty as Rescue Corps is to preserve the lives of the people. It's essential for us to act immediately in any situation."
"AND YET, our commander insists in relinquishing his Buster, despite being in the ARMED unit!"
"There are lives at risk!"
"His judgement is completely wrong!"
"Well..."
"Maybe you have a point..."
"But... you know..."

---PAGE 15---
"If you have something to say, say it to my face, Heel!"
"Commander!"
"Finish the investigation report and close the case."
"Heel, if you really think my judgment is wrong, you should file a complaint to the upper command..."
"I'll be in the analysis room if you need something else."
"Damn it!"
"Commander...!!"
"Hm?"
"U-Umm..."
"What's wrong, Boy? Don't tell me you don't know how to write a report..."

---PAGE 16---
"!"
"I believe in you, my commander!"
"Please excuse me..."
"Thank you, Boy..."
"... But I have already made up my mind...
"I won't return to that battlefield ever again..."

---PAGE 17---
"That's why I sealed the Buster..."
"To not lose any more friends..."
"To not let any more comrades fall defeated..."

---PAGE 18---
"W-Wha..."
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?!"

---PAGE 19---
"Anger, bloodlust, hatred, and every possible repugnance feeling against humanity..."
"This chip is even deleting the original program of the computer!"
"It was produced in a plant in Vilon..."
"Of course! It's the abandoned one...!"
"I'll have to..."
"Huh?!"

---PAGE 20-21---
"SIGMA!!!"
"Comm..."
"Commander!!"

---PAGE 22---
"Hah, hah, hah..."
"Commander? Are you okay, commander?"
"Yes. What is it?"
"An accident at coordinates B-L-R-X! Received order to depart!"
"Okay..."
"Did the chip's noxious gas affect me...?"
"But you know... it's still niggling my mind..."

---PAGE 23---
"Leaving people's lives in custody of a guy who doesn't use his own weapons is like, completely irresponsible..."
"Not that crap again!"
"Let him be."
"But commander...!!"
"You don't have to stop him, commander..."
"It was only to kill time, so don't worry..."
"Being transported is also part of the mission. Don't forget that."
"We have arrived at the accident place, commander! Prepare your unit!"
"This is..."

---PAGE 24-25---
"A living hell..."
"Dispatch the rescue units!"
"Wait, Heel! You call for the rescue units 7 and 9."
"Okay!"
"Keep going! Take them carefully!" 
"Please hang in there...!"
"G-Guh..."
"Woah!"
"Ugh... gigi..."
"These aren't humans!"
"It's a trap!"

---PAGE 26---
"I-Impossible..."

---PAGE 27---
"Boy!!"
"Robin!!"
"Bukeno!!"
"Iji!!"
"No...!"
"I don't want to lose any more comrades!"
"Haaaaaaah!"
"Huh?!"
"Bo..."

---PAGE 28---
"Boy?!"
"It's... hopeless..."
"It's too... late..."
"Let's just escape..."
"Boy!!"
"It's okay..."
"I can... walk..."
"But please..."
"Commander!!"
"Heel!"
"We did it, commander...!"
"We're safe now..."

---PAGE 29---

---PAGE 30---
"Guns are meant to be used, don't you think?"
"Otherwise it's pretty difficult to cope with the stress..."

---PAGE 31---
"HAAAAAAAAH!"
"What are you yelling to, my commander?"
"Gohooh!!"
"Hahaha..."

---PAGE 32---
"What the hell was that?! You're making my job WAY too easy...!"
"HE told me that I should infiltrate the Rescue Corps and wait for my chance... but I could have killed this guy anytime!!"
"If I inform HIM, I could as well snatch a good rise..."
"Anyway, it's time to say bye bye to this stupid truck..."
"Huh...? What's that sound?"

---PAGE 33---
"!!"
"I-Impossible!!"

---PAGE 34---
"Too bad..."
"You won't get any rise deep down in hell!"

---PAGE 35---
"HEEL!"

---PAGE 36---
"I'll destroy the chip plant next!"
"Anyone in my way will be my enemy!"

---PAGE 37---
"Aim better!"
"You're not really paying attention, are you?!"
"That little push destroyed him...?"

---PAGE 38---
"And you call yourselves guards?!"
"Get off!"

---PAGE 39---
"Are you deaf?! If you get in my way, I'll shoot you!"
"Is this the place...?"

---PAGE 40---
"Is it here where those evil seeds are produced?!"

---PAGE 41---
"Zero..."
"Mars..."
"Armage..."
"Eagleed..."
"All of you, taken away by this..."
"This chip that killed Boy today..."
"All because this chip...!!"

---PAGE 42---
"With all this anger..."
"I'm going to purify everything...!"

---PAGE 43---

---PAGE 44---
"A real guardian?"
"A bit late, don't you think?"
"Moving your arms and legs..."
"Like a spoiled brat..."

---PAGE 45---
"Is that all your brain is able to do?!"
"Are you trembling already?!"
"You're not enough to stop me!"

---PAGE 46---
"Haaaaah!"
"It's over..."

---PAGE 47---
"Those devilish chips won't be produced anymore..."
"This marks the beginning of our battle."
"?!"
"Do you..."
"Want to go to hell once more?!"

---PAGE 48---
"Sigma!"
"As arrogant as always! I can't say I don't like that side of yours!"

---PAGE 49---
"Sigma...!!"
"Relax. I won't invite you anymore..."
"My objective now..."
"Is to extinguish humanity..."
"And take revenge..."

---PAGE 50---
"ON YOU!"
"Woah!"
"I know you won't die by something like this..."
"That's why I gathered some strong soldiers, incomparable to anyone you have fought before..."

---PAGE 51---
"Incomparable to the easy battles you have experienced thus far..."
"Will you be able to reach me..."

---PAGE 52---
"X?!"
"At any cost..."
"Again and again and again..."
"I'll keep fighting."

---PAGE 53---
"The time has come!"
"In order to settle the score with the destiny that presents him yet another fight..."
"I'll keep sending you back to the darkness!"

---PAGE 54---

---PAGE 55---
After destroying Sigma's chip factory,
X is returning to the Hunters Base...
HOWEVER...!
(Chapter title says "Wiseman". Perhaps "Sage" sounds more natural?)

---PAGE 56---
"It's blazing hot here!"
"Anyway, I'm still fine..."

---PAGE 57---
(You can see an example of a heat-distorted road here: http://nightshift.opal.ne.jp/jp18/qub18108.jpg)
"But the high temperature is distorting the roads and causing serious accidents!"
"Huh?"
"Isn't that...?"
"Rain!"
"We're saved..."

---PAGE 58---
However, the rain that was still falling amidst the fierce heat
turned into a downpour and flooded the city.
"That mountain dome must be the reason behind all this!"
"The Weather Control Center... must have fallen in Sigma's hands!"
"Eh?!"

---PAGE 59---
"Hahaha...!!"
"?!"
"You're too green..."
"It's when you're rushing that you must be most careful..."
"Fishing helps a lot..."
"It keeps your heart calm and quiet."
"That doesn't mean you'll always find fishes, though..."
"I see..."

---PAGE 60---
"And this gramps used to build Reploids...?"
"Mmm...?"
"..."
"Excuse me, Doctor! I'm in a hurry right now...!"
"What?! Talk about a hasty sheep...!"
"I could run a little test here..."

---PAGE 61---
Weather Control Center
"Hah... hah..."
"Here starts the real deal!"

---PAGE 62-63---
"You're doing whatever you want, huh?"

---PAGE 64---
"Outta the way!"
"Hm?"
"This fog came from nowhere..."
"This dome's weather is projecting onto the city..."

---PAGE 65---
"I must free the Control Tower as soon as possible!"
"But where's the Control Room?!"
"Right there!"
"It's open...?"
"Someone's making a ruckus inside."

---PAGE 66---
"Dan-Dan-DAAAAANCE!!"
"Dan-Dan-DAAAAANCE!!"
"Huh...?"
"Tch!"
"Oh! A customer...?"
"What about you come here and dance for a lil' bit...?"

---PAGE 67---
"This magic stage will change the weather according to the drawing!"
"Whaddaya say?"
"Rollin' around the weather is really fun!"
"If you're not dancing then I'll go solo...!"

---PAGE 68---
"So the whole city is wrecking while you dance...?"
"Will you fight instead of dance?"
"I warn you that I'm no milksop!"
"You..."
"Do you have the faintest idea of what you've done?!"

---PAGE 69---
"Pffft..."
"Aren't you gonna fight face to face?"
"You're so boring..."
"I'm gonna beat you and discover Sigma's location!"
"Damn it! That string seems to be his shield..."
"Oh! So you want to gamble?!"
"I'M IN!"
"Eh?!"

---PAGE 70---
"Come on..."
"This time..."
"You're mine!"
"His shield is also a weapon!"
"However... that also means he's wide open!"
"What?!"

---PAGE 71---
"Don't you dare..."
"Try to move!"
"I did it!"
"What the hell are you doing...?"
"I don't get it..."
"What matters the most is the RYTHM!"
"Guess I'll have to lecture you about it..."

---PAGE 72---
"Woah!"
"These things are growing!"
"Clear out!"
"Avoid them if you can!"

---PAGE 73---
"GAH!"
"Damn it! Stop joking around!"
"You're just a weakling..."
"Hm?"
"Take this!"
"Your stupid tricks won't work twice!"
"Yahoo!"

---PAGE 74---
"Damn it!"
"I won't lose..."
"I CAN'T LOSE!!"

---PAGE 75---
"Ouch...!"
"You're so sadic..."
"There was no need to fight seriously!"
"This sucks...!"

---PAGE 76-77---
"You idiot...!"
"Uwaah!"
"Get your histeria off me!"
"This is it."
"Tell me Sigma's location. Now."

---PAGE 78---
"Uwaaah!"
"Ouch!"
"W-Who's there?"
"Hm... maybe it's a bit too strong..."

---PAGE 79---
"Dr. Cain! Are you involved in this conspiration too?!"
"Hah..."
"This is a total shame..."
"Take a good look there."
"?"
"Scared...?"
"Cut the crap!"

---PAGE 80---
"Is killing people the only thing you've learned?!"
"....."
"Okay..."
"..."
"Don't worry, just let me take a look at your body."

---PAGE 81---
"This guy just wanted to play..."
"Though he exceeded himself a bit, alright..."
"What?"
"He just wanted to play...?"
"Yep."
"In this fight I was expecting you to show me what you've learned, but it seems your anger got the best of you..."
"Here we go...!!"
"Ooh!!"

---PAGE 82---
"By the way..."
"I heard that you want to stop fighting."
"May I ask why?"
"Is it because every time you hold something in your hands...
you end up losing something equally important?"

---PAGE 83---
"Here!"
("坊主の武器" is literally "the weapon of the Buddhist priest (aka bald)" which I think refers to Cain.
HOWEVER, as this is used in more serious contexts in the same way, it could be more like "monk".)
"This is my Weapon Chip."
"It will be more useful in your possession."
"Okay, you're ready!"
"Whew...! Would you mind massaging the shoulders of this old monk?"
"Oh, sure..."
"What was I doing all this time?"
"Is he repaired already?"
"CO-HOH!!"
"I'm sorry!"
"Do you intend to break me apart?!"
"I-It's you...!"

---PAGE 84---
"Lord Cain!!"
"Hm? What do you want?"
"Woah...! Even Hetimarl calls him "Lord"!!"
"Hohohoho...!"
"This pop's something's else..."
(Little text) "Seriously...?"
"I'd rather just be called "Monk"."
"Eh?"

---PAGE 85---
"W-What is this...?"
"It's the graveyard where my children lost in the last war are resting..."
"I didn't create them to fight, and still..."
"Look."
"Ah!"

---PAGE 86---
"Zero..."
"Yes, this is the grave where your comrade rests..."
"But there's more to it than this."
"?"
"Hihihi..."
"What is it? Tell me!"
"Just have patience."

---PAGE 87---
"We're here."
"Ah..."

---PAGE 88-89---
(Manly tears)

---PAGE 90---
(This "nostalgic" future is a future that makes you feel nostalgic about in the far-future... or at least that's my interpretation.)
"Take... me with... you..."
"To that... nostalgic future... you'll build..."

---PAGE 91---
(Again calling him "Rockman X".)
"Hm, so this is X's power..."
"I don't see him as a threat, to be honest..."
"..."
"M-My... Metal Ball... will... rip him... apart..."

---PAGE 92---
"Don't take him lightly."
"Remember this brat is still HIS posthumous child..."
"Senile fears, I see..."
"Impertinent greenhorn! You can't be less discreet, can you...?!"
"Don't get mad. You could damage your circuits."
"I'm fine..."

---PAGE 93---
"We're the rivals of the Irregular Hunters..."
"The Counter-Hunters!!"

---PAGE 94---

---PAGE 95---

---PAGE 96---
"Kyaaah!!"
"W-What is this...?!"
"L-Look!!"
"The top of the mountain is falling apart!!"
"And another mountain is growing from it!!"

---PAGE 97---
"Unbelievable..."
"What's going on, Dr. Cain...?!"
"It's the "belly button"..."
"Huh?"
"If this volcano erupts, all the others volcanos connected with it inside the Earth will also flare up..."
"The volcanic ashes will obstruct the sun, converting Japan in a death country!"
"X! You must depart and stop Sigma's ambitions!"
"Yes sir!"

---PAGE 98---
"This sluggish plan is not my style..."
"But it'll certainly make HIM come here."
"The great Flame Stagger will finally face you!"
"I'll make you pay for what you've done!"
"Previous to Sigma's rebellion, a conflict arose with some members of the special A-class who commited unjustified brutality against the B-class."
"Furious about this, X challenged the leader of the A-class, Flame Stagger, to a personal duel."

---PAGE 99---
"If I win, you'll uncomplainingly change your attitude!"
"I'll show you where you do belong."
"That body of yours will never forget it!"

---PAGE 100---

---PAGE 101---
"Guh..."
"The duel's over."
"What...?! Are you saying that I lost, Zero?!"
"Yeah."
(Something's off with Zero's eyelashes...)
"Just accept it as an honorable defeat."
"I NEVER lose!"
"Come on, X! Cut your way through this lava baptism, and get to my side!"

---PAGE 102---
"I can't believe I have to do footrace in this base filled with lava!!"
"The ground is crumbling!!"
"The lava is swall---"

---PAGE 103---
"Woooooh...!!"
"Guh... these traps are dangerous."
"I must be careful..."
"What the...?!"

---PAGE 104-105---
"It's a magma lake!!"
"Is that rocky mountain their stronghold...?"
"Here I come!"
"Isn't there a place here without traps?!"

---PAGE 106---
"A dead end..."
(Yep, boss.)
"Isn't the boss supposed to be here...?"
"Still, this place is incredible..."
"Were they controlling the volcano from here?"

---PAGE 107---
"Anyway... I'm going back."
"Huh? That thing above...?!"
"GAH!"
"You're a punching bag..."

---PAGE 108---
"You're filled, FILLED, F I L L E D with openings...!!"
"Flame Stagger?!"
"No, his body's not the same as before..."
"In order to kill you at once, I asked Sigma for an upgrade!"

---PAGE 109---
"To kill me...? Don't tell me you're still around that...!"
"Yeah!! Your very life will wipe my shame..."
"You..."
"Did you sell your soul to Sigma for THAT?!"
"Hmph!!"
"Grrrr..."
"This is barely TICKLING me!"

---PAGE 110---
"You make me laugh."
"And laugh. AND LAUGH."
"YOU'RE JUST A BAD JOKE!"

---PAGE 111---
"Hah... Hah..."
"Hehehe..."
"Come on! Cry in anguish!"
"GAAH!"
"Enough sleep?"
"I'll get you up!"
"GAHAAH!"
"But it's still too early to wake up!!"

---PAGE 112---
"Well, aren't you gonna apologize?"
"It's not like you'll survive either way, though..."
"I won't allow it..."
"I don't care if you despise me..."
"But involving innocent bystanders is unforgivable!"

---PAGE 113---
"Y-You little worm..."
"I'll kill you, KILL YOU, K I L L  Y O U!!"
"I'M GONNA EXTERMINATE YOU!!"
"Your stupid goody-goody act..."
"It's intolerable..."

---PAGE 114---
"I hate it, HATE IT, H A T E  I T  T O  M Y  G U T S...!!"
"Guh..."
"Hmph."
"Ah... guh..."
"Maybe this lesson will erase his false sense of justice..."
"I don't think he'll ever wake up, though..."
"Hm?!"

"Those eyes..."
"THOSE EYES..."
"T H O S E  E Y E S...!!"

"Oh no..."

"My body didn't receive any damage!! Your vision field should've been reduced...!!"

---PAGE 126---
"Your body can be rock solid..."
"But your internal circuits were destroyed by my Buster at maximum point-blank range!"
"Even if my vision is damaged, I could localize your ECC (Energy Control Center) through my hearing!"
"I-Impossible..."
"To think the B-class would win against the A-class again..."
"I can't..."
"Believe it..."

---PAGE 127---
"I won't accept it!"
"I WON'T ACCEPT IT!"
"I  W O N ' T  A C C E P T  I T !!"

"!!"

---PAGE 130---
"I know it's late, but please allow us to introduce ourselves first..."
"My name is Agile."
"I'm Sagesse."
"There is one more of us called Violen..."
"But as today is an exceptional day... his introduction will have to be slightly delayed..."
"Who... are these guys...?"
"Please don't look at us with so much suspicion..."
"We are bodyguards under direct supervision of Master Sigma, the "Counter-Hunters"."

---PAGE 131---
"Under Sigma's supervision?!"
"Counter-Hunters?!"
"T-Then you came to..."
"No, no. Today we came only to introduce ourselves."
"Let's leave the duel for the next opportunity."
"Shut up!"
"Hold on!"
"Aren't you curious about our third comrade?"
"!!"
"Dr. Cain!!"

---PAGE 132---
"Did that "Violen" guy do all this?!"
"Ah!"
"I must check on Dr. Cain first!!"

---PAGE 133---
"Are you okay, Dr. Cain?!"
"O-Oh no!!"
"Dr. Cain!!"
"Are you okay?"
"Oh... it's you, X..."
